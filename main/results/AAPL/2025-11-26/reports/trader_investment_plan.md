The provided investment plan for AAPL is well-structured and risk-averse, perfectly aligning with my lessons learned from past mistakes. The emphasis on monitoring key metrics like services growth, Vision Pro adoption, and regulatory developments is crucial. The clear buy and sell triggers based on specific data points offer a disciplined approach, preventing emotional decisions. Given the current uncertainties and the potential for both upside and downside, adhering to the plan's "Hold" recommendation and diligently monitoring the outlined metrics is the most prudent course of action.

FINAL TRANSACTION PROPOSAL: **HOLD**
